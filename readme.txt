Hello, and thank you for using our Spotlight plugin!
License: GPLv2 or later
contributors: stevenboyce
Requires at least: 1.0.0
Tested up to: 1.0.0
Stable tag: 1.0.0
Requires PHP: 7.0

== Description ==
Spotlight is a dynamic header (for now) that you upload an audio file to give your website a voice.
Common uses are for ecommerce, podcasts, and anyone who wants to be able to speak directly to their web traffic to dramatically increase conversion.
See addspotlight.com for more explanation.

Major features in Spotlight include:

1. The ability to display the Spotlights you set up on our website, app.addspotlight.com (see addspotlight.com for a little explanation)
And that is all for now (:

== How it Works ==
- This plugin runs a JavaScript script that sticks a Spotlight banner at the top of the screen. It pushes all of your other content down in order to put itself at the top.
- It doesn't use cookies to track users
- 

== How To Use ==
- All you have to do is navigate to the Spotlight page in the admin dashboard, and input your workspaceId, as found in your settings => embed on app.addspotlight.com, then it all works like magic! The magic is embedding a header at the top of the site, as displayed on addspotlight.com

== Changelog ==

1.0.0 - May 12th, 2020
The first deployment. You can put in your workspaceId and it works as far as I have tested it locally

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
- Since this is a brand new plugin, we have to FAQ.
- You do need a Spotlight account to use this plugin. You can sign up for a free account at addspotlight.com or a paid one with some more features! Isn't that how it usually goes?
