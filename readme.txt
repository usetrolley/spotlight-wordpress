=== Spotlight ===

Hello, and thank you for using our Spotlight plugin!

Major features in Spotlight include:

1. The ability to display the Spotlights you set up on our website, app.addspotlight.com (see addspotlight.com for a little explanation)
And that is all for now (:

== How To Use ==
- All you have to do is navigate to the Spotlight page in the admin dashboard, and input your workspaceId, as found in your settings => embed on
app.addspotlight.com, then it all works like magic! The magic is embedding a header at the top of the site, as displayed on addspotlight.com

== Changelog ==

1.0.0 - May 12th, 2020
The first deployment. You can put in your workspaceId and it works as far as I have tested it locally
